Richard Hardstone is a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Perception and Brain Dynamics Laboratory of Biyu He (NYU Neuroscience Institute). His research interests include developing neurophysiological biomarkers to characterize sensory processing and neural disorders, and understanding the self-organizing dynamics of neural activity and behavior.
