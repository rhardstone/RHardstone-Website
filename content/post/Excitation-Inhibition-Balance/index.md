title: "Novel biomarker for estimating Excitation/Inhibition"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Balance between excitation &amp; inhibition is a key principle for neuronal network organization &amp; information processing, but has been difficult to quantify in humans. We developed a method to estimate E/I ratio non-invasively from ongoing oscillations."
