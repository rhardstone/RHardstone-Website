title: "Clinical applicability of fE/I biomarker will be tested in new grant from NWO"
subtitle: "Together with clinicians and researchers from Utrecht, Nijmegen and Twente, CNCR researchers Verhage, Cornelisse, Meijer (FGA) and Linkenkaer-Hansen (INF) received a €1,8M grant to improve personalized medicine for children with autism. A novel EEG biomarker of Excitation/Inhibition (fE/I), developed by Richard Hardstone in the team of Linkenkaer-Hansen, will be used to group children with ASD based on the balance between excitation and inhibition in their brain."
