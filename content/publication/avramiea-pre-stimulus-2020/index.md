abstract: Understanding why identical stimuli give differing neuronal responses and
  percepts is a central challenge in research on attention and consciousness. Ongoing
  oscillations reflect functional states that bias processing of incoming signals
  through amplitude and phase. It is not known, however, whether the effect of phase
  or amplitude on stimulus processing depends on the long-term global dynamics of
  the networks generating the oscillations. Here, we show, using a computational model,
  that the ability of networks to regulate stimulus response based on prestimulus
  activity requires near-critical dynamics—a dynamical state that emerges from networks
  with balanced excitation and inhibition, and that is characterized by scale-free
  fluctuations. We also find that networks exhibiting critical oscillations produce
  differing responses to the largest range of stimulus intensities. Thus, the brain
  may bring its dynamics close to the critical state whenever such network versatility
  is required.
