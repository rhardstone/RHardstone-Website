abstract: 'Resting-state neuroimaging is a dominant paradigm for studying brain function
  in health and disease. It is attractive for clinical research because of its simplicity
  for patients, straightforward standardization, and sensitivity to brain disorders.
  Importantly, non-sensory experiences like mind wandering may arise from ongoing
  brain activity. However, little is known about the link between ongoing brain activity
  and cognition, as phenotypes of resting-state cognition—and tools to quantify them—have
  been lacking. To facilitate rapid and structured measurements of resting-state cognition
  we developed a 50-item self-report survey, the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire
  (ARSQ). Based on ARSQ data from 813 participants assessed after 5 min eyes-closed
  rest in their home, we identified seven dimensions of resting-state cognition using
  factor analysis: Discontinuity of Mind, Theory of Mind, Self, Planning, Sleepiness,
  Comfort, and Somatic Awareness. Further, we showed that the structure of cognition
  was similar during resting-state fMRI and EEG, and that the test-retest correlations
  were remarkably high for all dimensions. To explore whether inter-individual variation
  of resting-state cognition is related to health status, we correlated ARSQ-derived
  factor scores with psychometric scales measuring depression, anxiety, and sleep
  quality. Mental health correlated positively with Comfort and negatively with Discontinuity
  of Mind. Finally, we show that sleepiness may partially explain a resting-state
  EEG profile previously associated with Alzheimertextquoterights disease. These findings
  indicate that the ARSQ readily provides information about cognitive phenotypes and
  that it is a promising tool for research on the neural correlates of resting-state
  cognition in health and disease.'
